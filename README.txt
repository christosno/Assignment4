~~ For the needs of questions 7 and 8, I added a little code to the T-shirt class.
~~ Τhe idea is to produce a number from all three attributes of the t_shirt, so that I can make the sorting you ask in question 7 and 8, through this number.
~~ I got this idea from here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42760959/vba-how-to-bubble-sort-with-two-criteria .

~ Αnswers:
    # For questions 1-3 (the first 1,2,3) i just present (at the beginning of main.py) the sorting algorthms, as requested.
    # For forty random t-shirts, i create tShirt_generator function.
    # For questions 1-8, i create six sorting algoritms (three for ascending, three for descending), 
      which they take as a parameter the sorting criteria (size, color, fabric, sizecolorfabric).
